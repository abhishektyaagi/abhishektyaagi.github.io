I was previously a Senior Engineer at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Samsung Research &amp; Development Institute</a>, Bangalore, India. Before that, I was a Research Assistant at <a href="https://cadl.iisc.ernet.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CAD Lab</a>, IISc, working with Prof SK Nandy.</p> <p>I am interested in building intelligent, efficient, and reliable computing systems inspired by humans and for humans. My research philosophy is to combine my interests in understanding the world around us (for example, human brain functioning) with my expertise in the area of computer architecture and design applications and systems that facilitate what we’ve yet to understand.</p> </div> <p>No links have been added yet.
