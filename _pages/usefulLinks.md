I am a Fifth Year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Rochester, advised by <a href='https://yuhaozhu.com/'>Dr. Yuhao Zhu</a>. I was previously a Senior Engineer at <a href='https://research.samsung.com/sri-b'>Samsung Research & Development Institute</a>, Bangalore, India. Before that, I was a Research Assistant at <a href='https://cadl.iisc.ernet.in/'>CAD Lab</a>, IISc, working with Prof SK Nandy.

I am interested in building intelligent, efficient, and reliable computing systems inspired by humans and for humans. My research philosophy is to combine my interests in understanding the world around us (for example, human brain functioning) with my expertise in the area of computer architecture and design applications and systems that facilitate what weâ€™ve yet to understand.

<!---My [research interest](/Blog/research_int/Refined_Research Interest.html) lies in Computer Architecture with current emphasis on designing efficient systems for emerging applications like Deep Neural Networks, Genomic Sequencing etc. In my pursuit of getting acquainted with various approaches taken towards hardware ?accelerators for machine learning workloads, I have reviewed a few articles and have been keeping their short-summaries (reviews) here.--->
